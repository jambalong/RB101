# If we build an array like this:

flintstones = ["Fred", "Wilma"]
flintstones << ["Barney", "Betty"]
flintstones << ["BamBam", "Pebbles"]

# We will end up with this "nested" array:

["Fred", "Wilma", ["Barney", "Betty"], ["BamBam", "Pebbles"]]

# Make this into an un-nested array.

flintstones.flatten!

# "Nesting data structures in this way is quite common in Ruby and programming in general. We will explore this in much greater depth in a future Lesson."
